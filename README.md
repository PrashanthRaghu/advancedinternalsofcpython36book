About the book:
This book is not a CS101: Programming with python book and so not meant for anyone looking to start programming with python to develop applications or projects. This book is meant for programmers who are interested in knowing about the internals of the programming language and how it is developed.

We shall look at it from a source code level and gain deeper understanding about the design philosophy of the language. This book is also intended for people who want to understand reading open source code and learning how to contribute to the community. It will also help potential Google summer of code prospectives. So if you are into any of these then do check out the book which is a first of itâ€™s kind analysis into the source code of an open source system.
